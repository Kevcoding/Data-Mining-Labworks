Data Mining and Machine Learning
Steps taken for most of these code snippets are:
Step1:Importing of Libraries to be used
Step2: Exploratory Data Analysis,
Step3: Data Pre-processing: Handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, 
Step4: Feature Engineering: data encoding, data transformation / data scaling
Step5: Model Development: Creation and Fitting
Step6: Model Evaluation: Classification reports, R2 Squared, MAE, MSE, F1 scores, Accuracy score.
Step7: Visualization of Training and Test sets.
Step8: Visualization of Results
